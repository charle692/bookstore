    author: 'Harold Bloom',
    publisher: 'Houghton Mifflin Harcourt',
    deleted: 'false',
    price: 5.00,
    summary: 'Harold Bloom explores our Western
    literary tradition by concentrating on the works of twenty-six authors
    central to the Canon. He argues against ideology in literary criticism;
    he laments the loss of intellectual and aesthetic standards; he deplores
    multiculturalism, Marxism, feminism, neoconservatism, Afrocentrism, and
    the New Historicism. Insisting instead upon "the autonomy of the
    aesthetic, " Bloom places Shakespeare at the center of the Western
    Canon. Shakespeare has become the touchstone for all writers who come
    before and after him, whether playwrights poets or storytellers. In
    the creation of character, Bloom maintains, Shakespeare has no true
    precursor and has left no one after him untouched. Milton, Samuel
    Johnson, Goethe, Ibsen, Joyce, and Beckett were all indebted to
    him; Tolstoy and Freud rebelled against him; and Dante,
    Wordsworth, Austen, Dickens, Whitman, Dickinson, Proust, the
    modern Hispanic and Portuguese writers Borges, Neruda, and
    Pessoa are exquisite examples of how canonical writing is born
    of an originality fused with tradition. Bloom concludes this
    provocative, trenchant work with a complete list of
    essential writers and books - his vision of the Canon.')

    summary: 'Those who work with words know how
    dramatically publishing has changed in the past decade, with technology now
    informing and influencing every stage of the writing and publishing
    process. In creating the fifteenth edition of the Manual, Chicago\'s
    renowned editorial staff drew on direct experience of these changes, as
    well as on the recommendations of the Manual\'s first advisory board,
    composed of a distinguished group of scholars, authors, and
    professionals from a wide range of publishing and business
    environments. Every aspect of coverage has been examined and brought
    up to date—from publishing formats to editorial style and method,
    from documentation of electronic sources to book design and
    production, and everything in between. In addition to books, the
    Manual now also treats journals and electronic publications. All
    chapters are written for the electronic age, with advice on how
    to prepare and edit manuscripts online, handle copyright and
    permissions issues raised by technology, use new methods of
    preparing mathematical copy, and cite electronic and online
    sources. A new chapter covers American English grammar and
    usage, outlining the grammatical structure of English,
    showing how to put words and phrases together to achieve
    clarity, and identifying common errors. The two chapters
    on documentation have been reorganized and updated: the
    first now describes the two main systems preferred by
    Chicago, and the second discusses specific elements
    and subject matter, with examples of both systems.
    Coverage of design and manufacturing has been
    streamlined to reflect what writers and editors
    need to know about current procedures. And, to
    make it easier to search for information, each
    numbered paragraph throughout the Manual is now
    introduced by a descriptive heading. Clear,
    concise, and replete with commonsense advice,
    The Chicago Manual of Style, fifteenth
    edition, offers the wisdom of a hundred
    years of editorial practice while including
    a wealth of new topics and updated
    perspectives. For anyone who works with
    words, whether on a page or computer
    screen, this continues to be the one
    reference book you simply must have.')

    price: 15.75,
    summary: 'For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an
    infamous prisoner named Sirius Black. Convicted of killing thirteen people
    with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord,
    Voldemort, and might even have assisted in the deaths of James and Lily
    Potter—Harry Potter\'s parents. Now Black has escaped, leaving only two
    clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter\'s defeat of You-
    Know-Who was Black\'s downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards heard
    him muttering in his sleep, "He\'s at Hogwarts... he\'s at Hogwarts."
    Of course, Harry already had plenty to worry about. After inflating
    his nasty aunt and running away on the magical Knight Bus, he finds
    he\'s being pursued by death omens at every turn. He receives two
    wonderful gifts: a top-of-the-line Firebolt broomstick, and the
    Marauder\'s Map, a magical diagram of Hogwarts made by the
    mysterious "Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs." Hermione
    disappears frequently, burdened down by a seemingly impossible
    course schedule. And the soulless Dementors have come to guard
    Hogwarts—supposedly to protect Harry from Sirius Black, but
    they terrify Harry more than the fugitive ever could. To
    strengthen himself against them, Harry reaches out to Remus
    Lupin, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who was
    once a friend of his father\'s. Lupin teaches Harry about
    the Patronus Charm, a defensive measure well above the
    level of magic generally mastered by wizards Harry\'s
    age. But even with his broom, his map, his magic, and
    his loyal friends, Harry isn\'t safe. Because on top
    of everything else, there\'s a traitor hidden at
    Hogwarts...')

    price: 15.75,
    summary: 'In Harry
    Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry is midway through both his training as a
    wizard and his coming of age. He wants to get away from the malicious
    Dursleys and go to the Quidditch World Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the
    Weasleys. He wants to dream about his crush, Cho Chang (and maybe do more
    than dream). And now that he\'s gotten the hang of things at Hogwarts—he
    hopes—he just wants to be a normal fourteen-year-old wizard. But even by
    his standards, Harry\'s year is anything but normal. First Dumbledore
    announces the revival of a grand competition that hasn\'t taken place
    for one hundred years: the Triwizard Tournament, where a Hogwarts
    champion will compete against rivals from two other schools of magic
    in three highly dangerous tasks. Then someone frames Harry to
    participate in the tournament—which really means someone wants him
    dead. Harry is guided through the competition by Professor
    Alastor Moody, this year\'s Defense Against the Dark Arts
    teacher, but he must also contend with a nasty reporter named
    Rita Skeeter, who digs up some highly unflattering secrets
    about Hagrid; a terrible fight with Ron, who is deeply
    jealous of Harry\'s fame; Hermione\'s newfound activism on
    behalf of house-elves; and the terrifying prospect of
    asking a date to the Yule Ball. Worst of all, Lord
    Voldemort may finally have gathered the materials
    necessary for his rejuvenation... and he has a faithful
    servant at Hogwarts waiting only for a sign. No,
    nothing is ever normal for Harry Potter. And in his
    case, different can be deadly.')

    the authorities at Hogwarts can stop. In response to his reappearance,
    Dumbledore reactivates the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society which
    works to defeat the Dark Lord\'s minions and protect his targets—
    especially Harry Potter. But Harry doesn\'t want to be protected. Even as
    the Ministry of Magic denies his claims, The Daily Prophet discredits
    him, and even Dumbledore won\'t look him in the eye, Harry grows more
    and more determined to fight his lifelong enemy Voldemort—if only he
    had the "weapon the Order is guarding. In the meantime, he visits his
    godfather at his ghoulish London home, Grimmauld Place, and learns
    more about Voldemort\'s deep reach into Wizarding history and the
    Wizarding world. Back at Hogwarts, Harry must deal with a Defense
    Against the Dark Arts teacher with a personality like poisoned
    honey; a surprising new member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team;
    the possibility of his first real romance; and the looming
    nightmare of the Ordinary Wizarding Level exams. He\'s haunted
    by dreams of a heavy door at the end of a silent corridor,
    and a vision of his father and the young Severus Snape that
    changes everything he thought he knew about them. Even the
    joy of working with "Dumbledore\'s Army" -a group of
    Hogwart\'s students dedicated to defeating Voldemort-

    summary: 'In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the summer after
    Harry\'s first year at Hogwarts has been his worst summer ever… the Dursleys
    more distant and horrible than ever before. But just as he\'s packing his
    bags to return to school, a creature named Dobby the house-elf announces
    that if Harry goes back to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. And it turns
    out, Dobby is right. Harry and Ron miss the Hogwarts Express, so they
    fly to school in a blue Ford Anglia, crash landing in the notorious
    Whomping Willow. Soon other worries accumulate: the outrageously
    stuck-up new professor Gilderoy Lockhart; a ghost named Moaning
    Myrtle, who haunts the girls\' bathroom; the strange behavior of
    Ron\'s little sister, Ginny Weasley; rumors about the "Chamber of
    Secrets," a cavern buried deep below Hogwarts; and a magical diary
    owned by Tom Riddle, a Hogwarts student of long ago. Harry is
    also shocked to discover that he can speak Parseltongue, the
    language of snakes - a rare ability that Lord Voldemort also
    possessed - and that anti-Muggle prejudice exists in the
    Wizarding world, even affecting Harry\'s friend Hermione.
    But all of these seem like minor concerns when someone
    starts turning Hogwarts students to stone: an evildoer said
    to be the fearsome Heir of Salazar Slytherin, on of the
    founders of the school. Could it be Draco Malfoy,
    Harry\'s most poisonous rival? Could it be Hagrid whose
    mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one
    person everyone at Hogwarts most suspects: Harry
    Potter himself?')

    summary: 'When Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince opens, the war against
    Voldemort has begun. The Wizarding world has split down the middle, and as
    the casualties mount, the effects even spill over onto the Muggles.
    Dumbledore is away from Hogwarts for long periods, and the Order of the
    Phoenix has suffered grievous losses. And yet, as in all wars, life goes
    on. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, having passed their O.W.L. level exams,
    start on their specialist N.E.W.T. courses. Sixth-year students learn
    to Apparate, losing a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt
    and fight and fall in love. Harry becomes captain of the Gryffindor
    Quidditch team, while Draco Malfoy pursues his own dark ends. And
    classes are as fascinating and confounding as ever, as Harry
    receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious
    Half-Blood Prince. Most importantly, Dumbledore and Harry work
    together to uncover the full and complex story of a boy once
    named Tom Riddle—the boy who became Lord Voldemort. Like
    Harry, he was the son of one Muggle-born and one Wizarding
    parent, raised unloved, and a speaker of Parseltongue. But
    the similarities end there, as the teenaged Riddle became
    deeply interested in the Dark objects known as Horcruxes:
    objects in which a wizard can hide part of his soul, if
    he dares splinter that soul through murder. Harry must
    use all the tools at his disposal to draw a final
    secret out of one of Riddle\'s teachers, the sly
    Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Finally Harry and
    Dumbledore hold the key to the Dark Lord\'s
    weaknesses... until a shocking reversal exposes
    Dumbledore\'s own vulnerabilities, and casts
    Harry\'s—and Hogwarts\'s—future in shadow.')

    Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance
    into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. From Sauron\'s fastness in
    the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron
    gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the
    One Ring that would complete his dominion.When Bilbo reached his
