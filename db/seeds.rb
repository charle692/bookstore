  title: 'The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages',
  author: 'Harold Bloom',
  publisher: 'Houghton Mifflin Harcourt',
  category: 'History',
  summary: 'Harold Bloom explores our Western
   literary tradition by concentrating on the works of twenty-six authors
    central to the Canon. He argues against ideology in literary criticism;
     he laments the loss of intellectual and aesthetic standards; he deplores
      multiculturalism, Marxism, feminism, neoconservatism, Afrocentrism, and
       the New Historicism. Insisting instead upon "the autonomy of the
        aesthetic, " Bloom places Shakespeare at the center of the Western
         Canon. Shakespeare has become the touchstone for all writers who come
          before and after him, whether playwrights poets or storytellers. In
           the creation of character, Bloom maintains, Shakespeare has no true
            precursor and has left no one after him untouched. Milton, Samuel
             Johnson, Goethe, Ibsen, Joyce, and Beckett were all indebted to
              him; Tolstoy and Freud rebelled against him; and Dante,
               Wordsworth, Austen, Dickens, Whitman, Dickinson, Proust, the
                modern Hispanic and Portuguese writers Borges, Neruda, and
                 Pessoa are exquisite examples of how canonical writing is born
                  of an originality fused with tradition. Bloom concludes this
                   provocative, trenchant work with a complete list of
                    essential writers and books - his vision of the Canon.'

  summary: 'Those who work with words know how
   dramatically publishing has changed in the past decade, with technology now
    informing and influencing every stage of the writing and publishing
     process. In creating the fifteenth edition of the Manual, Chicago\'s
      renowned editorial staff drew on direct experience of these changes, as
       well as on the recommendations of the Manual\'s first advisory board,
        composed of a distinguished group of scholars, authors, and
         professionals from a wide range of publishing and business
          environments. Every aspect of coverage has been examined and brought
           up to date—from publishing formats to editorial style and method,
            from documentation of electronic sources to book design and
             production, and everything in between. In addition to books, the
              Manual now also treats journals and electronic publications. All
               chapters are written for the electronic age, with advice on how
                to prepare and edit manuscripts online, handle copyright and
                 permissions issues raised by technology, use new methods of
                  preparing mathematical copy, and cite electronic and online
                   sources. A new chapter covers American English grammar and
                    usage, outlining the grammatical structure of English,
                     showing how to put words and phrases together to achieve
                      clarity, and identifying common errors. The two chapters
                       on documentation have been reorganized and updated: the
                        first now describes the two main systems preferred by
                         Chicago, and the second discusses specific elements
                          and subject matter, with examples of both systems.
                           Coverage of design and manufacturing has been
                            streamlined to reflect what writers and editors
                             need to know about current procedures. And, to
                              make it easier to search for information, each
                               numbered paragraph throughout the Manual is now
                                introduced by a descriptive heading. Clear,
                                 concise, and replete with commonsense advice,
                                  The Chicago Manual of Style, fifteenth
                                   edition, offers the wisdom of a hundred
                                    years of editorial practice while including
                                     a wealth of new topics and updated
                                      perspectives. For anyone who works with

                                        screen, this continues to be the one

  summary: 'For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an
   infamous prisoner named Sirius Black. Convicted of killing thirteen people
    with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord,
     Voldemort, and might even have assisted in the deaths of James and Lily
      Potter—Harry Potter\'s parents. Now Black has escaped, leaving only two
       clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter\'s defeat of You-
       Know-Who was Black\'s downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards heard
        him muttering in his sleep, "He\'s at Hogwarts... he\'s at Hogwarts."
         Of course, Harry already had plenty to worry about. After inflating
          his nasty aunt and running away on the magical Knight Bus, he finds
           he\'s being pursued by death omens at every turn. He receives two
            wonderful gifts: a top-of-the-line Firebolt broomstick, and the
             Marauder\'s Map, a magical diagram of Hogwarts made by the
              mysterious "Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs." Hermione
               disappears frequently, burdened down by a seemingly impossible
                course schedule. And the soulless Dementors have come to guard
                 Hogwarts—supposedly to protect Harry from Sirius Black, but
                  they terrify Harry more than the fugitive ever could. To
                   strengthen himself against them, Harry reaches out to Remus
                    Lupin, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who was
                     once a friend of his father\'s. Lupin teaches Harry about

                       level of magic generally mastered by wizards Harry\'s

  summary: 'In Harry
  Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry is midway through both his training as a
   wizard and his coming of age. He wants to get away from the malicious
    Dursleys and go to the Quidditch World Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the
     Weasleys. He wants to dream about his crush, Cho Chang (and maybe do more
      than dream). And now that he\'s gotten the hang of things at Hogwarts—he
       hopes—he just wants to be a normal fourteen-year-old wizard. But even by
        his standards, Harry\'s year is anything but normal. First Dumbledore
         announces the revival of a grand competition that hasn\'t taken place
          for one hundred years: the Triwizard Tournament, where a Hogwarts
           champion will compete against rivals from two other schools of magic
            in three highly dangerous tasks. Then someone frames Harry to
             participate in the tournament—which really means someone wants him
              dead. Harry is guided through the competition by Professor
               Alastor Moody, this year\'s Defense Against the Dark Arts
                teacher, but he must also contend with a nasty reporter named
                 Rita Skeeter, who digs up some highly unflattering secrets
                  about Hagrid; a terrible fight with Ron, who is deeply
                   jealous of Harry\'s fame; Hermione\'s newfound activism on
                    behalf of house-elves; and the terrifying prospect of
                     asking a date to the Yule Ball. Worst of all, Lord
                      Voldemort may finally have gathered the materials
                       necessary for his rejuvenation... and he has a faithful
                        servant at Hogwarts waiting only for a sign. No,
                         nothing is ever normal for Harry Potter. And in his

  summary: 'In
  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Lord Voldemort has returned to the
   Wizarding world, presenting a threat that neither the magical government nor

     Dumbledore reactivates the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society which
      works to defeat the Dark Lord\'s minions and protect his targets—
      especially Harry Potter. But Harry doesn\'t want to be protected. Even as
       the Ministry of Magic denies his claims, The Daily Prophet discredits
        him, and even Dumbledore won\'t look him in the eye, Harry grows more
         and more determined to fight his lifelong enemy Voldemort—if only he

  summary: 'In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the summer after
   Harry\'s first year at Hogwarts has been his worst summer ever… the Dursleys
    more distant and horrible than ever before. But just as he\'s packing his
     bags to return to school, a creature named Dobby the house-elf announces
      that if Harry goes back to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. And it turns
       out, Dobby is right. Harry and Ron miss the Hogwarts Express, so they
        fly to school in a blue Ford Anglia, crash landing in the notorious
         Whomping Willow. Soon other worries accumulate: the outrageously
          stuck-up new professor Gilderoy Lockhart; a ghost named Moaning
           Myrtle, who haunts the girls\' bathroom; the strange behavior of
            Ron\'s little sister, Ginny Weasley; rumors about the "Chamber of
             Secrets," a cavern buried deep below Hogwarts; and a magical diary
              owned by Tom Riddle, a Hogwarts student of long ago. Harry is
               also shocked to discover that he can speak Parseltongue, the
                language of snakes - a rare ability that Lord Voldemort also
                 possessed - and that anti-Muggle prejudice exists in the
                  Wizarding world, even affecting Harry\'s friend Hermione.

  summary: 'When Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince opens, the war against
    Voldemort has begun. The Wizarding world has split down the middle, and as
     the casualties mount, the effects even spill over onto the Muggles.
      Dumbledore is away from Hogwarts for long periods, and the Order of the
       Phoenix has suffered grievous losses. And yet, as in all wars, life goes
        on. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, having passed their O.W.L. level exams,

          to Apparate, losing a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt

            Quidditch team, while Draco Malfoy pursues his own dark ends. And
             classes are as fascinating and confounding as ever, as Harry
              receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious
               Half-Blood Prince. Most importantly, Dumbledore and Harry work
                together to uncover the full and complex story of a boy once
                 named Tom Riddle—the boy who became Lord Voldemort. Like
                  Harry, he was the son of one Muggle-born and one Wizarding
                   parent, raised unloved, and a speaker of Parseltongue. But
                    the similarities end there, as the teenaged Riddle became
                     deeply interested in the Dark objects known as Horcruxes:
                      objects in which a wizard can hide part of his soul, if

                         secret out of one of Riddle\'s teachers, the sly
                          Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Finally Harry and
                           Dumbledore hold the key to the Dark Lord\'s
                            weaknesses... until a shocking reversal exposes

    Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But
     the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout

  summary: 'At the age of forty-eight, writer and film critic David Denby
   returned to Columbia University and re-enrolled in two core courses in
    Western civilization to confront the literary and philosophical
     masterpieces -- the "great books" -- that are now at the heart of the
      culture wars. In Great Books, he leads us on a glorious tour, a
       rediscovery and celebration of such authors as Homer and Boccaccio,
        Locke and Nietzsche. Conrad and Woolf. The resulting personal odyssey
         is an engaging blend of self-discovery, cultural commentary,
          reporting, criticism, and autobiography -- an inspiration for anyone
           in love with the written word').save
